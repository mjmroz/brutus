brutus dust module: 3D dust mapping utilities.

This module provides tools for working with 3D dust maps, including coordinate
transformations and dust extinction queries. It's based on the `dustmaps`
package by Greg Green (Green et al. 2018) and implements interfaces for the
Bayestar 3D dust maps.

Classes
-------
DustMap : Abstract base class for dust maps
Bayestar : Implementation for Bayestar 3D dust maps

Functions
---------
lb2pix : Convert Galactic coordinates to HEALPix indices
